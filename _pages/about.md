Welcome on my Webpage! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher the [Institute of Applied Physics](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/49311579/) at the [Goethe University](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. My main research field is the fascinating topic of linear particle accelerators (called "linacs").

Currently I am teaching the following courses at Goethe University, Frankfurt:

***Introduction to Accelerator Physics***: [OLAT-Link](https://olat-ce.server.uni-frankfurt.de/olat/auth/RepositoryEntry/15168503815)

Laser Applications in Particle Accelerators: [OLAT-Link](https://olat-ce.server.uni-frankfurt.de/olat/auth/RepositoryEntry/15168503817)
