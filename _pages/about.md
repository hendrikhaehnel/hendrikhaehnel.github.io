Welcome on my Webpage! I am substitute Professor for Accelerator Physics at the [Institute of Applied Physics](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/49311579/), [Goethe University](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. My main research field is the fascinating topic of linear particle accelerators (called "linacs").
